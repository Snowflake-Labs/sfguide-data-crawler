# Tagging
The Solution Innovation Team provides frameworks, accelerators, and other pieces of sample code to customers via multiple channels, ranging from specific 1:1 engagements to public open-source.  As part of our continual improvement process for all of our code, we review how our customers are leveraging these tools, how that code is performing, and what functionality might need to be updated and aligned with the Snowflake core product.  While our tagging of objects and sessions is meant to provide improvements back to our customers, we also understand that not all of our customers will maintain this tagging.

Some of the benefits for our customers for leaving the tagging in place include:

- Performance improvements, cost optimization, or additional functionality
- Communication of fixes, improvements, or alignment to Snowflake product features to customers that are leveraging the code
